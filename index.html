          I'm more than just an option
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          Refuse to be forgotten
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          I took a chance with my heart
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          And I feel it taking over
          
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
          
          I'm more than just a number
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          I doubt you'll find another
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          So every single summer
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          I'll be the one that you'll remember and
          
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
          
          It's more than just a mission
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          You hear, but you don't listen
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          You better pay attention
          (Hey, hey, hey)
          And get what you've been missing
          
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
          
          Too many times I've been wrong
          I guess being right takes too long
          I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
          But give all I have to you and
          
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I better find your loving, I better find your heart
          I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
          
          I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
